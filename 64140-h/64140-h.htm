<p class="ph1">SOUP AND SOUP MAKING.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Soup is so convenient, economical and healthful,
that as an article of diet it ranks second in importance
only to bread; and soup making is justly
entitled to a prominent place in the science of
cookery.</p>

<p>A simple soup or broth of good quality, delicately
seasoned with salt and pepper, or containing
some of the grains, or grain products, is always acceptable,
and none of the more complex soups that
can be readily secured by a judicious introduction
of vegetables, herbs and spices ever meet with popular
disfavor.</p>

<p>There are enough scraps of cooked and uncooked
meats, trimmings of roasts, steaks, chops, cutlets
and so on in nearly every house to keep the family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
supplied with nutritious, palatable soup, with very
little trouble and at only a slight expense for additional
material. And as the best dinner can
generally be preceded with advantage by a light
soup of some kind, to an ordinary, cold, or &#8220;picked-up&#8221;
family dinner, a plate of soup is an invaluable
adjunct, and can be prepared in a few minutes in
a kitchen where the value of the stock pot is recognized,
and the economy of good cooking understood.</p>

<p>Soup scientifically prepared is easier of digestion
than almost any other article of diet. The solid
matter which enters into its composition and
would in the original form require several hours
for digestion, is so broken down in the process of
preparation that it can be readily assimilated with
very little expenditure of vital force; and being
absorbed by the stomach as soon as eaten, goes immediately
to nourish the system.</p>

<p>But soup to fulfill its true mission must be attractive
in appearance, agreeable in flavor and unmistakable
in character. It must not be a weak,
sloppy, characterless compound, nor a crude,
greasy, inharmonious hodge-podge. The defects
of unsavory, unpalatable, indigestible soups may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
be concealed, but can not be removed by the excessive
use of salt, pepper and other spices and condiments.
And in order that soup of any kind may
legitimately aspire to high rank, either as a nutritive
or hygienic agent, it must be skillfully prepared,
so as to please the eye and gratify the
palate.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO MAKE SOUP STOCK.</h2>
</div>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">A STOCK POT.</span></h3>

<p>Any ordinary pot or kettle can be used for preparing
stock, but as a &#8220;digester&#8221; or stock pot is
one of the most useful utensils known to the culinary
art, and can be obtained at almost any hardware
store, no kitchen should be without one.
The cook, who is provided with a stock pot, and
habitually uses it two or three times a week, can
utilize all available scraps, and generally has a
supply of stock on hand from which an acceptable
soup, or delicious sauce can be improvised in a
short time, and with very little trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>The stock pot should not remain on the stove or
range, and fresh material be added from time to
time to that which is partly or wholly cooked; but
whenever a quantity of scraps accumulate they
should be carefully prepared and put to cook.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">SOUP STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>A great many soups are made without the previous
preparation of a specially distinctive stock.
But stock has as legitimate an existence in soup
making, as ferment has in bread making; and its
recognition is quite essential to a perfect understanding
of the subject. Stock is the base of soups.
It is the fluid foundation with which other materials
are mixed, and skillfully incorporated into soups,
that in modern bills of fare are bewilderingly designated
potages, purees, and consommes.</p>

<p>Soup stock, in the strictest sense of the term, is
the fluid extract of meat or meat and bones, and is
of two kinds:&mdash;simple and compound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simple</span> stock is the extract from a single kind of
flesh, fish or fowl. <span class="smcap">Compound</span> stock is the extract
from two or more kinds of flesh, fish or fowl mingled
and cooked together, or mixed together, after
being cooked separately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">HOW TO MAKE SOUP STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>To make stock, meats of any kind cut in small
pieces, or meat and bones well cut and broken,
should be put in a pot in cold water slightly salted,
and the water heated very gradually until it
reaches the boiling point, after which it should be
kept simmering gently for a longer or shorter time,
according to the nature and quantity of the material
used, and the consistency of the stock wanted.
When sufficiently cooked, it should be removed
from the fire, strained into a jar or bowl, and set
in a cool place.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">QUANTITY OF WATER.</span></h3>

<p>Authorities differ somewhat in regard to the
quantity of water that should be used in preparing
stock and making soup.</p>

<p>If the simmering is to continue six or eight
hours, as some recommend, a little more water is
required than when it is to continue only half that
length of time. But as the correct proportions are
about one quart of water to each pound of meat
and bones, it is absurd to use an additional quantity
of water, and waste time and material in reducing
the stock to the proper consistency by evaporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">QUANTITY OF SALT.</span></h3>

<p>The principal object of using salted water in the
preparation of stock, is to facilitate the separation
of the blood and slime from the meat. The quantity
of salt used should be regulated by the condition
of the meat, and in no case more than an
ounce of salt to each gallon of water.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">REMOVING THE SCUM.</span></h3>

<p>The blood and slime when thrown to the surface
in the form of scum, should be removed as rapidly
as it rises. If permitted to remain after the
water reaches the boiling point, it will be speedily
incorporated with the stock, and injure its appearance
and flavor. A little cold water poured into
the pot the moment it boils, will hasten the rising
of the scum.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">SOAKING AND SIMMERING THE MEAT.</span></h3>

<p>The albumen of all meats, like the albumen or
white of eggs, is curdled and hardened by heat,
but is readily soluble in cold water, and mixes
quietly with it; and when meat is put to cook in
cold water, and soaked until the water reaches the
boiling point, and afterward permitted to only simmer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
all its juices are extracted, and mingled with
the liquid so perfectly as to greatly improve the
flavor, and add to the nutritive properties of the
stock or soup.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">QUALITY OF THE MEAT.</span></h3>

<p>The flavor of soup depends upon the quality of
the materials of which it is made. Tough and
coarse pieces of meat, when the meat is of good
quality, make good soups and sauces, and can be
converted into stock advantageously, as can also a
great many rough, refuse bits and scraps; but it is
very important that all meats of which stock is to
be made, should be cooked before they get tainted,
or stale; in fact, the fresher the meat, the better
will be the quality of the stock made from it.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">BEEF TEA.</span></h3>

<p>Especial care should be observed in regard to the
freshness of the meat for beef tea, which comes
under the generic name of soup, being merely a
plain soup stock. A cut from the round, on account
of its juiciness, is preferable, for beef tea. In
preparing it, all skin and fat should be removed,
and the beef cut into small pieces. It should then
be covered with cold water, and allowed to soak for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
several hours, when the water should be brought
slowly to the boiling point. This tea is not so nutritious
as stock simmered for two or three hours,
but is believed by physicians to exercise a special
tonic and exhilarating influence upon the system
independent of any directly nutritive quality it may
possess.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">CONSISTENCY OF STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>The consistency of stock depends greatly upon
the material used, and the length of time it is
cooked. Bones contain a large quantity of gelatinous
matter, and when equal portions of meat and
bones are used, the stock, when cold, will be quite
stiff and gelatinous; and the longer it is allowed to
simmer, the more stiff and gelatinous it will become.
If meat alone is used, or if the stock is
cooked but a short time, it will remain in liquid
form.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">TIME REQUIRED FOR MAKING STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>When meat and bones are well cut and broken
up, all their valuable qualities will by proper soaking
and simmering be extracted in two or three
hours; and although longer cooking will render the
stock thicker and more gelatinous, it is not advisable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
to continue it a greater length of time, as the
nutrition of soup depends very little, if at all, upon
the amount of gelatine it contains, and its flavor
is injured by too much cooking.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">STRAINING, COOLING AND KEEPING STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>Stock, when sufficiently cooked, should be carefully
strained, and unless wanted for immediate
use should be set where it will cool as rapidly as
possible. The quicker it cools the finer will be its
flavor, and the greater the length of time it can be
kept. In cold weather stock will keep fresh and
sweet for several days; but in summer, unless kept
in a cold place, it will be necessary for its preservation,
to put it over the fire and bring it to a boil,
or &#8220;scald it&#8221; every day.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">SALTING STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>After stock has been strained and while still
warm, all the salt that will be needed in the soups
or sauces to be prepared from it, can be added with
advantage, as it becomes thoroughly incorporated
with the stock and aids in its preservation.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">COOKING VEGETABLES IN STOCK.</span></h3>

<p>Many cook books recommend putting vegetables
into the stock pot with the meat and cooking them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the same length of time. But as vegetables that are
cooked several hours with meat are apt to give
the stock a rank taste, and also to cause it to ferment
in a short time in warm weather, such a
method is objectionable in making stock. Where
economy is a prominent consideration, or where
the stock is to be used immediately in soup, it is
perhaps as well to simmer the meat and vegetables
together a sufficient length of time to extract all
their flavor and nutriment.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">CLASSIFICATION OF SOUPS.</h2>
</div>


<p>After the stock has been properly made there is
comparatively little trouble attending the preparation
of any kind of soup desired; and it may be
proceeded with at once, by the addition of spices,
vegetables and other articles, or may be postponed
till another day, and for another occasion.</p>

<p>The variety of soups is illimitable and can be
increased almost indefinitely, as it requires but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
new combination of materials to entitle a soup to
a distinctive name, and as grotesque a one as its
originator may choose to bestow upon it.</p>

<p>All soups, however, can be classified and arranged
under five heads, viz.:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>
1. Plain soup.<br />
2. Clear soup.<br />
3. Vegetable soup.<br />
4. White soup.<br />
5. Mixed soup.</p>
</div>

<p>To one or the other of these divisions everything
in the nature of soup belongs; and a little
intelligent thought will enable the cook to select
the materials adapted to, and appropriate for use in
each division.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">FLAVOR AND COLOR OF SOUP.</span></h3>

<p>The flavor of the solid material, either animal or
vegetable from which a soup takes its name, should
always predominate when the soup is served, and
only such spices should be added in its preparation
as have a tendency to bring out, and perfectly
develop the flavor of the dominant article.</p>

<p>This proposition holds good, and should be conformed
to also, in regard to the color; so far, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
least, as to prohibit the introduction of dark colored
vegetables, spices, etc., into light colored
soups.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">REMOVING THE GREASE.</span></h3>

<p>Before using stock for soup, the first thing to be
done is to remove from it all superfluous grease.
When it is to be used without being permitted to
cool, a little cold water poured into it as soon as
strained, will cause the grease to rise to the surface
so it can be skimmed off without difficulty. If it
is set aside till cold, the grease will form in a cake
on the top of the stock, and can be taken off when
convenient, but, as it excludes the air, it is better
to let it remain till the stock is needed.</p>


<h3>CLASS ONE.</h3>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN SOUPS.</span></h4>

<p>Plain soup, in its strictest sense, is either simple
or compound stock seasoned with salt, or with salt
and pepper. The addition of some of the grains or
grain products, generally improves the flavor and
increases the nutritive value of any simple soup or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
broth, but does not take it out of the category of
plain soup.</p>

<p>Prominent among, and strikingly illustrative of
this class of soups, is</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN CHICKEN SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>The flesh of the fowl from which the stock is to be
made, should, with the exception of the breast, be
cut into small pieces, and the bones broken. The
breast, with the skin as perfect as possible, should
be placed in the pot whole, on top of the prepared
material, and removed as soon as tender. To each
quart of stock, when strained and skimmed, add an
ounce of rice, and let simmer three-quarters of an
hour, then add the breast of the chicken, cut in
dice, a little minced parsley, and salt and pepper
to taste. Plain chicken soup is much improved if
about a pound of round steak be cut up and cooked
with the fowl.</p>

<p>To this soup add a pint of sweet cream, thicken
with flour, and flavor highly with celery, and the
product will be a much admired white soup&mdash;cream
of celery soup;&mdash;or if the celery and cream
be omitted, the addition of half a teaspoonful of
curry powder will transform it into a choice Mulligatawny
soup.</p>

<h3>CLASS TWO.</h3>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">CLEAR SOUPS.</span></h4>

<p>Clear soup is made from simple or compound
stock, by straining and clarifying. It can be seasoned
with salt, pepper and other condiments, or
with salt and pepper alone. In the preparation of
clear soups, herbs, spices and vegetables are frequently
cooked with the stock, and strained out,
and the soup then clarified. All soups that are
made with a foundation of clarified stock, or that
have clear soup for a base, can be thickened with
arrow root, corn starch and similar articles, or
flavored with various vegetables, cereals, etc., without
losing their distinctive name or character, provided
care be taken to use only such articles as will
not injure the clearness of the soup. As excellent
illustrations of this class of soups take&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>No. 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">AMBER SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Put a gill each of sliced onion, carrot, turnip
and parsnip, fried to a delicate brown, together
with the bits of ham or bacon with which they
were fried, into a soup kettle; add to them a sprig
each of parsley and thyme, half a bay leaf, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
cloves, five pepper corns, and cover with five quarts
of plain or compound stock. Simmer gently for
an hour, strain, remove the grease, and clarify.
Heat to boiling point, season with salt and pepper,
add a tablespoonful of caramel and serve. If properly
made, and carefully strained and clarified, this
soup will be as transparent as amber.</p>


<h4><i>No. 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">TOMATO SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>To four quarts of clear soup, add a quart of
strained stewed tomato, a teaspoonful of sugar, a
tablespoonful each of corn starch and butter stirred
together, and salt and pepper to taste. Boil a few
minutes and serve.</p>


<h4><i>No. 3.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">JULIENNE SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>To four quarts of clear soup, add a gill each of
carrot, parsnip, turnip, celery, string beans, core of
lettuce, and a small onion, cut into thin pieces
about an inch in length, and simmer gently until
all the vegetables are tender. Season to taste with
salt and pepper, and ten or fifteen minutes before
serving the soup, put into it a few water cresses or
some sorrel leaves. If all the vegetables are not
readily obtainable, one or more of them can be
omitted without serious detriment to either the
flavor or title of the soup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>


<h3>CLASS THREE.</h3>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">VEGETABLE SOUPS.</span></h4>

<p>Vegetable soup is made by cooking vegetables in
either simple or compound stock; or a special stock
may be prepared by adding water or milk to the
juice extracted from vegetables. A vegetable soup
may contain but a single vegetable; or it may contain
a variety of vegetables, and be of any color desired.
The vegetables may be cooked a longer or
shorter time, and left in, or strained out of the
soup according to taste or fancy.</p>


<h4><i>No. 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">PLAIN VEGETABLE SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>To three quarts of stock add a gill each of sliced
carrot, turnip, parsnip and onion, and simmer gently
till tender. Half an hour before serving, add
a stalk of celery cut in small pieces, or two or three
sprigs of parsley. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>A number of plain vegetable soups quite different
in character can be very readily compounded
by using a greater or smaller variety of vegetables,
or by adapting the combination to the season and
the appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>


<h4><i>No. 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">ONION SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Fry in an ounce of butter or clarified drippings,
till a light brown, two or three large onions sliced
thin; then add two ounces of flour and stir till
about the same color. Mix thoroughly with a
pint of cold stock, place over the fire in a soup
kettle, and when it comes to a boil pour in a quart
of boiling milk into which three boiled potatoes,
mashed to a smooth paste have been stirred. Season
with salt and pepper and serve hot. Water can be
used instead of stock in this soup, if more convenient,
and the soup still be delicious.</p>


<h4><i>No. 3.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">DRIED PEA SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Soak for several hours, or over night, a pint of
dried peas in two quarts of cold water. Drain and
put to cook in four quarts of cold water, with a
quarter of a pound of breakfast bacon or salt pork,
fried to a light brown. As soon as the water boils
skim carefully, cover closely and let simmer gently
three or four hours, or until the peas are very tender.
Strain and return the soup to the kettle, add
a teaspoonful of sugar, two quarts of stock, and,
when boiling, a tablespoonful each of flour and
butter. Season with salt and pepper, and serve
with toasted bread cut in dice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>Pea soup can be made in this manner without
the bacon or pork, in which case it is advisable to
use a cup of sweet cream instead of the butter, and
to season delicately with celery. Sweet corn is a
very desirable mixture for pea soup, and sugar
may be dispensed with when it is used. The addition
of a little crushed spinach juice will convert
this into a nice green pea soup.</p>

<p>If the spinach juice be omitted, and a cup of dark
rich gravy, a spoonful of caramel, and a flavoring
of herbs and spices be substituted, the entire character
of the soup will be so changed that it must
be transferred to the list of mixed soups.</p>


<h3>CLASS FOUR.</h3>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">WHITE SOUPS.</span></h4>

<p>Veal, chicken, fish, oysters and other shell fish
furnish the stock for most white soups, and cream
or milk enters largely into the composition of
many of them. One of the leading characteristics
of white soups is the prohibition of everything
that has a tendency to color; hence, comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
few vegetables, herbs and spices are legitimately
permissible in their composition as seasoning and
flavoring. With certain restrictions, however, a
greater number can occasionally be introduced
with appropriateness, and sometimes be given even
a prominent place.</p>

<p>An illustration is furnished in</p>


<h4><i>No. 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Cut off, about an inch in length, the points of
two bunches of asparagus, and simmer them gently
until tender in water sufficient to cover them, to
which a teaspoonful of salt has been added. Boil
the stalks of the asparagus twenty minutes in three
pints of white stock or water, then strain and
thicken the liquid with a tablespoonful of flour, let
it boil two minutes, and add a pint of sweet cream
and the asparagus points with the water in which
they were cooked. Season with salt and pepper,
and serve hot.</p>


<h4><i>No. 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">CORN SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>A delicious white soup can be made by simmering
a pint of sweet corn in a quart of white stock
for fifteen minutes, then adding a quart of boiling
milk and a small piece of butter, and seasoning
with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>


<h4><i>No. 3.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">A RICH WHITE SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Simmer for an hour in three quarts of white
stock a gill each of white turnip, onion and celery
cut in small pieces, together with a blade of mace.
Strain, thicken with two ounces of flour, boil two
minutes, add half a pint of sweet cream and season
with salt and pepper. When about to boil stir
in the well beaten yolks of three eggs, and serve.</p>


<h3>CLASS FIVE.</h3>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">MIXED SOUPS.</span></h4>

<p>Delicacy in seasoning and flavoring is pre-eminently
the distinguishing mark of a fine soup of
any kind; but to mix, mingle and combine many
different articles of food so as to produce a soup
whose flavor is distinct from any single ingredient
entering into its composition, yet embodying the
best qualities of each, is the true criterion of merit
in a mixed soup.</p>

<p>Nearly all soups are in a certain sense mixed
soups; but plain, clear, vegetable and white soups,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
have distinctive characteristics by which they can
be recognized, and their genuineness established,
while the individuality of a mixed soup must be
evolved from the harmonious adjustment of seemingly
discordant materials, and depends in a great
measure upon the good judgment, discriminating
taste and artistic skill of the person who prepares
it.</p>

<p>An illustration of a mixed soup that can not be
placed under any other division is</p>


<h4><i>No. 1.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">MOCK TURTLE SOUP.</span></h4>

<p class="center">Ingredients:</p>

<p>A calf&#8217;s head, a beef soup bone, five quarts cold
water, one onion, one turnip, one carrot, one half
stalk celery, one half bunch parsley, one bay leaf,
one lemon, five cloves, ten allspice, ten pepper
corns, one fourth nutmeg, two teaspoons of salt, a
little cayenne pepper, two ounces butter, one ounce
flour&mdash;a glass of wine to each quart of soup.</p>

<p>Put the head after removing the brains with the
spices in the soup kettle, and cover with three
quarts of cold water to which half a teaspoonful of
salt has been added.</p>

<p>When it boils skim carefully and let simmer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
four or five hours, removing the meat as soon as
tender. Strain and set aside till next day. Put
the beef bone and vegetables in the soup kettle and
cover with two quarts of cold water to which half
a teaspoonful of salt has been added, and simmer
four hours, removing the scum as it rises. Soak
the brains in cold salt water an hour, tie in a linen
cloth and boil gently twenty minutes in salted
water. Plunge an instant in cold water to render
white and firm. Cook two ounces butter and one
ounce of flour in a sauce pan till very brown. Put
both soup stocks together in the kettle, after all
grease and settlings have been removed, also the
meat from the head cut in small dice, and the
yolks of a dozen hard boiled eggs, and when it
boils add the brains cut in small pieces. Put the
lemon, cut in thin slices, in a heated tureen, with
a gill of wine for each quart of soup; pour the
boiling soup on them, and serve.</p>


<h4><i>No. 2.</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">SAVE-ALL SOUP.</span></h4>

<p>Collect the scraps left from breakfast and dinner,
for instance, a half pint of soup, a gill of gravy, a
half pint of mashed turnip or potato, a little macaroni
cooked with cheese, a sour baked apple or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
broiled chop or steak, etc., etc.; put them in the
stock pot or soup kettle with sufficient cold water,
simmer for an hour, removing any scum that rises,
then strain and set aside. Next day remove the
grease, put the soup to cook, and when it boils, season
with salt and pepper, and if it seems to need
other seasoning add a pinch Of thyme, or celery
seed, or a teaspoonful of sugar. It is sometimes
well to put half a bay leaf and two or three cloves
in the kettle with the scraps. The flavorings and
spices required in a mixed soup of this description
depend greatly upon the nature of the scraps used.
If they are mostly light and delicate, thyme, mace,
celery, or parsley can be added; if dark and heavy,
cloves, bay leaf, sweet marjoram or a little Worcestershire
sauce, or walnut or other catsup can be
used more appropriately. Sometimes an ounce
each of butter and flour cooked together in a saucepan
till browned, and then added to the soup, give
it the very thing it lacks; or it may be that the
flour stirred with a gill of cold sweet cream is what
is needed to make it a perfect soup.</p>

<p>To select and harmonize the materials for a
mixed soup is one of the best evidences of culinary
capacity; and the cook who can do this successfully,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
is qualified to prepare a soup of the most
complex as well as one of the simplest character,
without regard to its name or class.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">OYSTER SOUPS.</span></h3>

<p>These all belong to the white soup class, but
they occupy so anomalous a position&mdash;an oyster
soup being simply an oyster stew with additional
liquid, and a thickening of flour&mdash;that they deserve
special mention.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">TO STEW OYSTERS.</span>&mdash;<i>No. 1.</i></h4>

<p>Rinse a quart of oysters in cold water, drain
through a sieve. Put a piece of butter the size of
an egg in a stew pan, and when melted add a pint
of milk and let it come to a boil; add the oysters,
and the moment the edges curl remove from the
fire; season with salt and pepper. Serve with
small crackers, or on thin slices of buttered toast.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">TO STEW OYSTERS.</span>&mdash;<i>No. 2.</i></h4>

<p>Pour a pint of cold water over a quart of oysters,
stir well and drain; put the liquor in a stew pan
greased with butter; when it boils, skim, add the
oysters, season to taste with butter, salt and pepper,
and cook and serve as in No. 1.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>In changing an oyster stew to a soup, the thickening
and extra liquid should be added and cooked
before the oysters are put into it.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">POTAGES, PUREES AND CONSOMMES.</span></h3>

<p>These are French terms used to designate different
kinds of soups; but they are applied so indiscriminately
as to possess very little significance,
even for culinary adepts; and the dividing line between
a potage, a puree, a consomme, and an ordinary
soup, is so imaginary as to be indistinct to
plain every-day people. But as a foreign or grotesque
name does not detract from the quality of a
good thing, those who prefer to call a soup a potage,
a puree or a consomme, can do so with impunity,
and not legally infringe on the domain of any professional
cook.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">HOW TO SCALD SOUP.</span></h3>

<p>To scald stock or soup properly, it must be
brought to the boiling point and thoroughly heated.
Its liability to ferment and grow sour is only increased
by merely re-warming it.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">WHEN TO ADD FLAVORING.</span></h3>

<p>Vegetables when used merely to flavor soups
should be simmered only long enough to extract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
their juices; and aromatic spices, orange and lemon
juice, and other liquid flavorings whose subtle
essences are driven off by heat, should be added
barely a sufficient length of time before the soup is
served, for them to blend and harmonize with the
other materials&mdash;in fact it is usually better to put
them in the tureen and pour the soup over them
just before it goes to the table.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">ORDER OF ADDING VEGETABLES.</span></h3>

<p>Where several kinds of vegetables are used in the
preparation of a soup, care should be taken to put
those that require most cooking in the kettle first;
and, if possible, to limit the simmering of each kind
to the time actually necessary to cook it tender.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">BROWNING VEGETABLES.</span></h3>

<p>Breakfast bacon and ham give a peculiarly fine
flavor to many soups, and when they are used the
vegetables added to such soups should be browned
in the fryings of the meat; but when neither bacon
nor ham is used, the vegetables should be browned
in butter, as in most cases they impart a richer
flavor to the soup, if nicely browned in a little
grease before being added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">VEGETABLES, ETC., ADAPTED TO SOUPS.</span></h3>

<p>While nearly all kinds of vegetables, herbs,
spices and cereals can be appropriately used at
pleasure in clear, vegetable and mixed soups, those
specially adapted to white soups are: cauliflower,
potato, white turnip, onion, celery, salsify, cresses,
capers, olives, parsley, thyme, rice, macaroni, vermicelli,
tapioca, sago, mace, and red and white
pepper.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">TO CLARIFY SOUPS.</span></h3>

<p>To each gallon of soup add, while cold, the
whites and shells of two eggs beaten with a little
cold water, simmer for fifteen minutes, removing
the scum as it rises, and then strain through a
flannel cloth or bag.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">CARAMEL.</span></h3>

<p>Preparations for coloring and flavoring soups
can be obtained at almost any grocery by those
who wish to use them. But caramel, which is innocent
and cheap, is one of the best coloring materials,
and is easily prepared:&mdash;</p>

<p>Stir half a pound of sugar and a spoonful of
water in a saucepan over the fire till a bright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
brown, then add half a pint of water, boil a few
minutes and strain. Caramel made in this manner
will keep a considerable length of time if put
in an air-tight jar or bottle.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">THICKENING FOR SOUPS.</span></h3>

<p>When flour, corn starch, farina or arrow root are to
be used as thickening for soups they should be stirred
to a smooth paste with cold milk, cream, or butter,
and then added to the boiling soup. If the flour is
desired brown it should be cooked with butter before
it is added to the soup.</p>


<h3><span class="allsmcap">ADDITIONS TO SOUPS.</span></h3>

<p>Eggs cooked in a variety of ways, croutons,
noodles, dumplings, force meat balls, and a dozen
other articles that are manufactured for the purpose,
are used according to fancy as additions to
soups. Some of them are cooked in the soup and
served with it, and some are cooked separate and
put in the tureen or the individual plates, and the
soup poured over them.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">CROUTONS.</span></h4>

<p>A bit of toasted or fried bread is called in
French a crouton; and croutons, which are simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
bits of bread toasted or fried brown, are very nice
in a variety of soups. The bread can be toasted in
the ordinary way and used dry, or it can be buttered,
cut in dice and toasted brown in the oven, or fried
brown in butter or drippings. The best way of
serving croutons is to put a spoonful of them in
each plate and pour the hot soup over them.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">NOODLES.</span></h4>

<p>The noodle is one of the traditional articles for
serving in soups. It is a general favorite and is
easily made:</p>

<p>To three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of water, and
a pinch of salt, add flour enough to make a stiff
dough. Work and knead fifteen or twenty minutes,
roll to a very thin sheet, dust lightly and evenly
with flour, and roll up compactly. Then with a
thin sharp bladed knife cut into very thin slices
and let dry for a couple of hours before putting in
the soup. They will cook in five minutes. Or,</p>

<p>Beat an egg very light, add flour until stiff enough
to roll into little crumbs the size of wheat or rice
grains, drop into boiling soup and cook a few minutes.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">DUMPLINGS.</span></h4>

<p>A very delicate dumpling for soup can be made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of biscuit dough, raised with either yeast or baking
powder, in this manner: roll the dough thin,
cut into dice, roll under the hand on a floured board,
and steam for twenty minutes; put in the tureen
and pour boiling soup over them.</p>

<p>But the most delicate of dumplings are made
of light bread crumbs, suet or marrow, egg and
seasoning. These can be varied in seasoning to
suit any soup. This is a good combination for a
clear, white or delicate soup of any kind. Mix
well, but lightly, a tablespoonful uncooked beef
marrow and half a pint bread crumbs, seasoned
with salt, pepper, grated lemon peel and mace;
add one well beaten egg, roll into balls in the
hands, and drop into the boiling soup. They
should be served as soon as they rise to the surface.</p>


<h4><span class="allsmcap">FORCE MEAT BALLS.</span></h4>

<p>To four parts cooked veal, and one part suet
minced together, add four parts bread crumbs and
season with salt, pepper, powdered cloves and sweet
herbs. Bind together with beaten egg, make into
small balls and fry brown. These are much
used in mock turtle and other heavy soups.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&trade; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&trade; License.

other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

        You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&trade; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade;

or any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
